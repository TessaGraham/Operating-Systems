There are four operating system functions: Processor Manager, Memory Manager, Device Maanger, and File Manager. Processor Manager
manages real time, and gives the device the capability of multitasking. There are three states that this manager can be in, these
are Running, Ready, and Blocked. This manager controls the central processing unit. The Processor Manager usually works with the
Memory Manager, the File Manager, and the Device manager.
